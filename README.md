Exam criteria:

Valid HTML/CSS (no errors, warnings, etc)

Semantic markup (nav, navigation as a list, section for section, etc)

Everything should look in accordance with the design (fonts, colors, background, borders, shadows, border-radiuses, etc). The exception: large margins, padding, width, height are not allowed.

Use normalize.css/reset.css

Use Google Fonts, Font Awesome

All interactive elements should have hover and/or focus styling

Add Favicon to the website

Use Sass

It should look similar/same in Chrome, Firefox

Completeness: it's better to have all sections created with some imperfections than one perfect section. On the other hand, it's better to have one perfect section than the whole website that is a total mess. So you need to find balance and create the whole website
